Requires:
# Hybris packages
- libhybris-libEGL
- libhybris-libGLESv2
- libhybris-libwayland-egl
# This new reworked libhybris (minimalhooks) now contains the linker, but
# eventually will require to split into libsf as well for mediatek devices.
# Keeping everything in detritus for now before splitting
- libhybris-detritus

# Bluetooth
- bluetooth-rfkill-event-hciattach

# Sensors
- hybris-libsensorfw-qt5

# Vibra
- ngfd-plugin-droid-vibrator
- qt5-feedback-haptics-droid-vibrator

# Needed for /dev/touchscreen symlink
- qt5-plugin-generic-evdev

- pulseaudio-modules-droid
- pulseaudio-modules-droid-glue
# for audio recording to work:
- qt5-qtmultimedia-plugin-mediaservice-gstmediacapture

# These need to be per-device due to differing backends (fbdev, eglfs, hwc, ..?)
- qt5-qtwayland-wayland_egl
- qt5-qpa-hwcomposer-plugin
- qtscenegraph-adaptation

# Add GStreamer v1.0 as standard
- gstreamer1.0
- gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
- gstreamer1.0-plugins-base
- gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad
- nemo-gstreamer1.0-interfaces
- gstreamer1.0-droid

# This is needed for notification LEDs
- mce-plugin-libhybris

## USB mode controller
# Enables mode selector upon plugging USB cable:
- usb-moded

# hammerhead, grouper, and maguro use this in scripts, so include for all
- rfkill

# enable device lock and allow to select untrusted software
- jolla-devicelock-daemon-encsfa

# For devices where test_gps eventually gets a fix:
- geoclue-provider-hybris
